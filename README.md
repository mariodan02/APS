Project work relativo all'esame di Algoritmi e Protocolli per la Sicurezza informatica

# 📚 Overview
This project implements a decentralized system for selective sharing and revocation of academic credentials in the context of the Erasmus student mobility program. The system addresses critical security, privacy, and interoperability challenges in international academic credential exchange.

# 🚀 Key Features

- Decentralized Architecture: Eliminates dependency on central authorities for credential verification
- Privacy-Preserving: Implements selective disclosure to share only necessary information
- Revocation Support: Dynamic and publicly verifiable credential revocation mechanism
- Cross-Institutional Interoperability: Seamless credential exchange between different universities
- Resource-Efficient: Optimized for devices with limited resources (hardware wallets)

# 🎯 Problem Statement
Current academic credential exchange systems face significant challenges:

- Reliance on central authorities for verification
- Privacy violations through over-sharing of student information
- Lack of standardized revocation mechanisms
- Poor scalability and interoperability across different systems

This project provides a comprehensive solution using modern cryptographic techniques and decentralized architectures.

# 🏗️ System Architecture
The system consists of four main work packages:

WP1: Threat Modeling & Requirements

- Definition of honest actors (students, universities, accreditation bodies)
- Comprehensive threat model analysis
- Security properties and resilience requirements
- Credential structure specification

WP2: System Design

- Authentication mechanisms for all participants
- Academic credential structure with selective disclosure
- Revocation protocol design
- Network and memory efficiency optimizations

WP3: Security Analysis

- Formal security verification
- Attack vector analysis
- Privacy guarantees validation
- Performance-security trade-off evaluation

WP4: Implementation & Performance

- Simulated environment implementation
- Performance benchmarking (credential size, verification latency)
- Practical deployment considerations
